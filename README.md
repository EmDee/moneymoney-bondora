# moneymoney-bondora
MoneyMoney extension for Bondora

### Installation

Copy this extension to your MoneyMoney's extensions folder (default: `~/Library/Containers/com.moneymoney-app.retail/Data/Library/Application Support/MoneyMoney/Extensions`).

**Note**: Currently this extension has not been signed, thus it will only work if you're running MoneyMoney's beta version.

### Usage

The extension will work for Bondora's Go & Grow, I haven't tested it for the other Bondora products.
